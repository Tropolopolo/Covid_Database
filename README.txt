These files are for the compeletion of Project 2 Phase 3 for the class Databases and File Systems
at the University of Texas at Arlington, taught by Professor Bhanu Jain.
TAs - Donna Safaddin and Ariella Amanuel<br><br>

PAGES:<br>
http://localhost/Covid/Covid.php<br>
<br>

We used the MVC setup - each page has it's own HTML and controller file named xxxxxx.controller.php.<br>

We also provided proof of each query directly on the page for ease of access, rather than checking
in phpMyAdmin.<br>
